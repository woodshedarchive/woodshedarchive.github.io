# Bootleg Project
Opensource/Free community based music production and distribution process.  THe goal is to foster peace love and contentment between small teams of pre, post, artists, electronic media production,secrtity, office admin and system programers based on copyleft ideas and open source rapid application development methodology.

On the opensource software side we rely on a bare metal server with a fat pipe paid for montly by our community.  We have a bunch of old system programmers running a stack based on Centos runing KVM containters and Docker containters.  The secuirty really makes be feel safe and cozy.
