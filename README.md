# Bootleg Project
Opensource/Free comunity based music production and distribution process.  THe goal is to foster peace love and contentment between pre, post, artists and paetrons based on copyleft ideas and open source rapid application development methodology.

On the opensource software side we rely on a bare metal server with a fat pipe paid for montly by our community.  We have a bunch of old system programmers running a stack based on Centos runing KVM containters and Docker.
