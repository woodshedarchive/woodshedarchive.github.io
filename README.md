# Bootleg Project
Opensource/Free community based music production and distribution process.  The goal is to foster peace love and contentment between small teams of pre, post, artists, electronic media production, security, office admin and system programers based on copyleft ideas and open source rapid application development methodology.

On the opensource software side we rely on a bare metal server with a fat pipe paid for montly by our community.  We have a bunch of old system programmers running a stack based on Centos runing KVM containters and Docker containters.  The security really makes be me feel safe and cozy.  We have taken a very respectful effort to be secure please don't hack us but if you do please tell us by sending a pgp encrypted email to archivist@woodshedarchive.org with the details of our stupidity.
