# Bootleg Project
The objective is to create a sustainable distributed image and audio digital media archive for artists, muses, and patrons.  The premise is similar to a to an Air Bed and Bed, but instead of a single place to stay for a person the new archive will provide multiple simultaneous transients and permanent storage locations for media to remain for real-time,  near time, and extended storage and retrieval purposes.

Look out of any window  
Any morning, any evening, any day  
Maybe the sun is shining  
Birds are winging, no rain is falling from a heavy sky  
What do you want me to do  
To do for you to see you through?  
For this is all a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago  

Walk out of any doorway  
Feel your way like the day before  
Maybe you'll find direction  
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you  
What do you want me to do  
To watch for you while you're sleeping?  
Then please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too  

Look into any eyes  
You find by you; you can see clear to another day  
Maybe been seen before  
Through other eyes on other days while going home  
What do you want me to do  
To do for you to see you through?  
It's all a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago  

Walk into splintered sunlight  
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land  
Maybe you're tired and broken  
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear  
What do you want me to do  
To do for you, to see you through?  
A box of rain will ease the pain and love will see you through  

Just a box of rain, wind and water  
Believe it if you need it, if you don't just pass it on  
Sun and shower, wind and rain  
In and out the window like a moth before a flame  

And it's just a box of rain, I don't know who put it there  
Believe it if you need it or leave it if you dare  
And it's just a box of rain, or a ribbon for your hair  
Such a long, long time to be gone and a short time to be there
